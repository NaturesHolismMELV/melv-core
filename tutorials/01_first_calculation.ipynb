    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The i-factor** quantifies interaction efficiency:\n",
    "   - i = resource_overlap / service_differentiation\n",
    "   - Simple ratio with profound implications\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Critical threshold at i ≈ 1.0**:\n",
    "   - Below: Cooperation emerges (synergy through differentiation)\n",
    "   - Above: Competition dominates (conflict through overlap)\n",
    "   - Sharp bifurcation, not gradual transition\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Universal applicability**:\n",
    "   - Same mathematics for birds, platforms, organizations\n",
    "   - Cooperation is energetic efficiency, not altruism\n",
    "   - Validated with r = -0.944 correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Practical implications**:\n",
    "   - To increase cooperation: ↓ overlap OR ↑ differentiation\n",
    "   - To reduce competition: Create unique value (↑ δ)\n",
    "   - Small changes near threshold have large effects\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tutorial 2**: Agent-based validation (reproduce October 2025 results)\n",
    "- **Tutorial 3**: Real data analysis (apply to your domain)\n",
    "- **Documentation**: Explore β-factor (compatibility) calculations\n",
    "- **Community**: Share your applications and insights\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Meta-Point\n",
    "\n",
    "**In 20 minutes, you went from zero to calculating cooperation dynamics.**\n",
